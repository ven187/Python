# About the Python repo 

## Description

This repo will contain the solutions I developed in the Python programming language, the code fragments I used, and the patches I applied. The project will contain functional and practical tools that I have created to meet my needs, as well as innovative approaches to problems I have encountered. My goal is to keep these resources organized and easily accessible when needed.
